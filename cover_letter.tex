\cvparagraph{About Me}
I have advanced knowledge of the frontier between natural language processing and point cloud data. I earned a Master's degree in Computational Mathematics at Ohio State while working a full time job as a programmer for the Department of Homeland Security. Then I moved to New Jersey and began creating business value out of clever applications of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as the Chief Data Scientist at Avlino. At Avlino I have also mentored a team of young, brilliant data scientists, taught them clean coding style, version control, and parallel processing, and helped them prepare talks and research papers. I am looking to continue working (and learning) in a place tackling interesting, real-world problems, with a team of inspiring people. I work primarily in Python and C++ in linux environments, but I've also worked in R, Scala, Java, and a handful of other languages. Feel free to ask me hard questions about Dynamic Programming or Graph Algorithms too, I have a solid background in algorithms.


\cvparagraph{Why AT\&T?}
I want to work in a place where I can fully utilize my skill set. I've reviewed the requirements for Senior-Inventive Scientist, and while the title makes me feel a little bit shy, I believe I have the academic credentials and the work experience to become a valued employee.

\cvparagraph{What's Next?}
I would be honored if you would invite me in for a job interview.
