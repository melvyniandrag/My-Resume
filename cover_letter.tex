\cvparagraph{About Me}
I create computational solutions to hard problems, ranging from diffusion to predictive analytics, and beyond. I love Python, C++, and CUDA, and I am a big proponent of functional programming. I'm also fascinated by the way that computers work, and I have engineer-level knowledge of how processors process, assembly assembles, and memory memorizes.

\cvparagraph{Why NJCU?}
NJCU is my alma mater, and I'd like to contribute to its rise as a top-notch university. "There are few things in life more interesting than computing", and I'd like to work with young people to help them understand why this is true. There is a lot of potential for greatness in NJCU students, and I'd like to help students achieve this greatness.

\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
I write complex software. I have a deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I can teach version control and coding style.  I'm very active ``in the scene"\footnote{I'm writing to you from the ODSC conference in Boston, and I'll be presenting at the Central NJ Data Science group in June, and at PyGotham in NYC in July. I contribute to open source projects.}, can help your students see what it is to be a programmer, and can help them find employment. In short, I would be a \textbf{no-nonsense professor} with lots of truth and inspiration for your students.
\cvparagraph{What's Next?}
At my current job I regularly interview prospective software engineers. I ask them questions like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How would you implement a function that takes $x$, $y$, $z$ as input and returns $a$ as output?
\item What is the complexity of the \textit{foobarbaz} algorithm?
\item Can you explain what \textit{state} refers to in the concept of computer programming?
\end{enumerate}
I would be honored if you would have me in to ask me similar questions (and potentially offer me a job)!
