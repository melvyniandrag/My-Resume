To Whom It May Concern,
    People's opinions of DEKA seem somewhat divided, with a 2.9 score on glassdoor. I am quite confident that I would fall into the percentage of people who love it. This is because I have a long standing ambition to create a specific medical application and DEKA seems vested in medical applications. Whether or not we were able to produce the tool I have been dreaming of, I'm sure that the work you are currently doing is equally interesting and likely more reasonable.
    I could potentially be a valuable addition to your staff. blah blah biography here.
    we could be a good fit, and I would be honored for an interview.
