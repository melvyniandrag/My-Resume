\end{center}
\cvitem{ Calisto Studios }{ }
\cvitem{Priority Queue Hospital}{A C++ project I worked on while preparing for interviews. Uses as many language features and STL containers as possible, illustrates the purpose of several data structures, and uses SDL2 for animation.}
\cvitem{Epithelium}{Master's Thesis. Simulator of the development of epithelial tissue. Code solves a complicated system of differential equations to evolve the appearance of a tissue and drive the cells to an equilibrium configuration. Generates animations of the tissue morphogenesis.}
\cvitem{Kaggle Contests}{Participant in Kaggle data science contests. Code is available on my github.}
\cvitem{Heat Solver}{PDE solver with many visualization options. Solves the heat equation in 1 and 2 dimensions. I presented this code as a tutorial at the PyOhio conference in 2014, and the video can be seen online. I still regularly get emails from people all over the US, Europe and South America using my code for their research or teaching.}
\cvitem{8 Color Network}{Network analysis tool for with a gui for studying the evolution of unstructured networks with local interactions. Python and tkinter.}
\cvitem{Python Chess}{Implemented advanced moves such as pawn promotion in an unfinished game found on github.}

\section{Relevant Work Experience}
\cventry{February 2017 - Present}{Software Engineer}{\textsc{DEKA Research \& Development}}{Manchester, NH}{}{ Working on low level and middleware for innovative medical devices. While I cannot talk about the specifics of the machines I work on, I can sketch what type of work I do. I was hired to rewrite a system-critical library written in C in a more easily digestible OO C++ style. This task has required my full 40 hours a week for about six months as I had to not only redesign a library but also modify every call to its functions in every process in our stack that used it. I also had to produce documentation, unittests, integration tests, and verify that timing requirements were satisfied. Another aspect of the project was to eliminate the use of all UTF16 encoded strings and replace them with UTF8 strings (this was no small feat! You could contact Mark Niemeyer, a senior dev at the company who just recently reviewed my work. He apologized for having assigned me this task since he hadn't realized just how much code was going to need to be rewritten. He thanked me for getting the job done quickly and without complaining - this was one of the most satisfying professional compliments I have ever received. ).}

\cventry{October 2015 - February 2017}{Lead Data Scientist}{\textsc{Avlino, Inc.}}{Holmdel, NJ}{}{Principal developer of machine learning software at a growing startup. Specialized in summarization and classification of terabytes of social media data. Led a team of junior employees, encouranging good software practices like automated testing, clean code writing, and use of version control with verbose commit messages. Coded in Python, R, Scala and C++ and used Hadoop, Spark, MapReduce, and other tools as needed. Our software caused a strike at a major telecommunications company because it automated too many jobs.}
